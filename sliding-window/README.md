# sliding window

many array problems ask us to _find_ or _calculate_ something among contiguous subarrays of a given size. these can be reduced to a 'sliding window' pattern, which is a fixed or dynamic subarray that we're looking for within in an array. 

mindset: 
break the problem into two portions:
- when you're _expanding the window_ and 
- when you're _shrinking the window_.

easy
- [Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K](max-sum-subarray-of-size-k.py)
- [Smallest Subarray with a given sum](smallest-subarray-with-given-sum.py)

medium
- [Longest substring with K distinct characters]()
- [Fruits into Baskets]()

hard
- [No-repeat Substring]()
- [Longest Substring with Same Letters after Replacement]()
- [Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement]()
