# sliding window

many array problems ask us to _find_ or _calculate_ something among contiguous subarrays of a given size. these can be reduced to a 'sliding window' pattern, which is a fixed or dynamic subarray that we're looking for within in an array. 

mindset: 
break the problem into two portions:
- when you're _expanding the window_ and 
- when you're _shrinking the window_.

ðŸ¥º easy
- [maximum sum subarray of size k](max-sum-subarray-of-size-k.py)
- [smallest subarray with a given sum](smallest-subarray-with-given-sum.py)

ðŸ˜ª medium
- [longest substring with k distinct characters]()
- [fruits into baskets]()

ðŸ¤¯ hard
- [no-repeat substring]()
- [longest substring with same letters after replacement]()
- [longest subarray with ones after replacement]()
