# sliding window

many array problems ask us to _find_ or _calculate_ something among contiguous subarrays of a given size. these can be reduced to a 'sliding window' pattern, which is a fixed or dynamic subarray that we're looking for within in an array. 

mindset: break the problem into two portions -- when you're _expanding the window_ and when you're _shrinking the window_.

problems
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- Smallest Subarray with a given sum
- Longest substring with K distinct characters
- Fruits into Baskets
- No-repeat Substring
- Longest Substring with Same Letters after Replacement
- Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement
